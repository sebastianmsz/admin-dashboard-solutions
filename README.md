# Admin Dashboard Solutions
Hello, this is the repository for the Admin Dashboard Solutions page project! On this page, you can find the mock-up for a full dashboard. I created it to practice my skills in laying out pages and to develop appealing designs. As a bonus, you can also find all the projects I've completed so far following the Odin Project curriculum, conveniently located in one place.
